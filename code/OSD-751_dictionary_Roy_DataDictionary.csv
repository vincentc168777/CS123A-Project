western blot,Roy_Brain_WesternBlot_TRANSFORMED.csv,Caspase-1,caspase1_relative_density,arbitrary_units,"Relative density of Caspase-1 normalized to actin. 'arbitrary_units' are relative measurements without a standardized physical reference, used when the absolute value is less important than the comparison between samples. They represent quantities on a scale defined by the specific instrument, protocol, or experiment rather than universal physical units. In this case, it's used in place of 'relative density units'  in order to maintain database consistency."
