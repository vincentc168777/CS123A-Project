# CS123A-Project

Project: Effects of Space Flight on Inflammasome Activation in the Brain of Mice (Cortex; ECLIA) - OSD-751 (Version 3)
Course: CS123A - Bioinformatics

Overview:
----------
This project analyzes the OSD-751 dataset from NASA's Rodent Research 1 Mission to understand how spaceflight affects inflammasome activation in the brain of mice. The dataset includes results from an ECLIA assay, focusing on inflammatory cytokine levels in spaceflight vs. ground and baseline mice.

The goal is to extract, analyze, and visualize data trends related to cytokine expression using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. We also explored logistic regression for classification.

Dataset Summary:
----------------
- Mice: C57BL/6
- Mission: Rodent Research 1 aboard SpaceX-4 (Sep 21 - Oct 25, 2014)
- Method: Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA)
- Focus: Cytokines including TNF-alpha, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-10

Hello! We're Hetav and Vincent, and we're the authors of this GitHub repository!  
We created this mini project for our CS123A - Bioinformatics class, where we explored the intersection of biology and AI/ML.  
We applied logistic regression to classify experimental groups based on cytokine expression data and learned a lot from working with real biological datasets.
